  - Data: Hydrogen chloride,carbontetrachloride

* Objective
  - To view the Introduction of the "Measurement of Dipole Moment " experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/physical-sciences-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Measurement of Dipole Moment /Measurement of Dipole Moment _01_Usability_smk.org][Measurement of Dipole Moment _01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Introduction link 
  2. Check if there are distortions and junk characters present in the Introduction page
  3. Click on the 'Play the Animation' link
  4. Select type of chloride from the dropdown list present at the corresponding field
  5. Click on the restart button
  6. Now change the type of chloride and repeat 5th step again

* Expected result
  1. Introduction page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to anew page with the animation presentation displaying on the screen
  4. When we select type of chloride from the dropdown list present at the corresponding field,the equivalent dipole moment and polarizability values should be displayed on the screen and the order of the molecules should also be displayed on the screen through the animation presentation 
  5. When we click on the restart button again the order of the molecules should be displayed on the screen through the animation presentation

* Review/comments
